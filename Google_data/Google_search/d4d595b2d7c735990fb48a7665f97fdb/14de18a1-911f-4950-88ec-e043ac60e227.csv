Zero-Shot Learning Through Cross-Modal Transfer,http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5027-zero-shot-learning-through-cross-modal-transfer.pdf,This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the object class. The only necessary knowledge about.
Zero-shot Learning via Simultaneous Generating and ...,http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8300-zero-shot-learning-via-simultaneous-generating-and-learning.pdf,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a learning paradigm that proposes an elegant way to fulfill this desideratum by utilizing semantic descriptions of seen and ...
Zero-shot recognition with unreliable attributes,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5290-zero-shot-recognition-with-unreliable-attributes,We propose a novel random forest approach to train zero-shot models that explicitly accounts for the unreliability of attribute predictions. By leveraging ...
