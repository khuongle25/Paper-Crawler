Zero-shot Learning with Semantic Output Codes - NIPS papers,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3650-zero-shot-learning-with-semantic-output-codes,"Abstract. We consider the problem of zero-shot learning, where the goal is to learn a classifier f:X→Y f : X → Y that must predict novel values of Y Y that ..."
The Emergence of Objectness: Learning Zero-shot ...,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/6d9cb7de5e8ac30bd5e8734bc96a35c1-Abstract.html,"Humans can easily detect and segment moving objects simply by observing how they move, even without knowledge of object semantics. Inspired by this, we develop ..."
Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners,http://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/8bb0d291acd4acf06ef112099c16f326-Abstract-Conference.html,"While these successes are often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding Let's think ..."
