An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/romera-paredes15.pdf,Zero-shot learning consists in learning how to recognise new concepts by just having a descrip- tion of them. Many sophisticated approaches.
SDM-Net: A Simple and Effective Model for Generalized Zero ...,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v161/daghaghi21a/daghaghi21a.pdf,"Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is a classification task where some classes referred to as unseen classes have no training images. Instead, we only have side."
Co-Representation Network for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zhang19l/zhang19l.pdf,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is an important field in computer vision. It aims at classifying images of unseen classes through establishing mathematical ...
