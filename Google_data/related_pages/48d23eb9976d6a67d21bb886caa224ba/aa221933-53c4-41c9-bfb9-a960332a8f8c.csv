Transferrable feature and projection learning with class hierarchy for zero-shot learning,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-020-01342-x,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones so that the latter can be recognised without any training samples. This is made possible by …
Zero-shot node classification with graph contrastive embedding network,https://openreview.net/forum?id=8wGXnjRLSy,"This paper studies zero-shot node classification, which aims to predict new classes (ie, unseen classes) of nodes in a graph. This problem is challenging yet promising in a variety …"
Knowledge distillation classifier generation network for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9552442/,"In this article, we present a conceptually simple but effective framework called knowledge distillation classifier generation network (KDCGN) for zero-shot learning (ZSL), where the …"
Explanatory object part aggregation for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10287616/,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects from unseen classes only based on labeled images from seen classes. Most existing ZSL methods focus on optimizing feature …
Creativity inspired zero-shot learning,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Elhoseiny_Creativity_Inspired_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2019_paper.html,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims at understanding unseen categories with no training examples from class-level descriptions. To improve the discriminative power of zero-shot …
Multi-modal generative adversarial network for zero-shot learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095070512030215X,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), where the test instances are from the novel categories that no visual data are available during training. The …"
Prototypical priors: From improving classification to zero-shot learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01192,Recent works on zero-shot learning make use of side information such as visual attributes or natural language semantics to define the relations between output visual classes and then …
Contrastive embedding for generalized zero-shot learning,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Han_Contrastive_Embedding_for_Generalized_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.html,"Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to recognize objects from both seen and unseen classes, when only the labeled examples from seen classes are provided. Recent …"
ZeroNAS: Differentiable generative adversarial networks search for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9612044/,"In recent years, remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved by generative adversarial networks (GAN). To compensate for the lack of training samples in …"
Dual part discovery network for zero-shot learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3503161.3547889,Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by transferring knowledge from seen classes. Recent methods focus on learning a common semantic space to align visual …
