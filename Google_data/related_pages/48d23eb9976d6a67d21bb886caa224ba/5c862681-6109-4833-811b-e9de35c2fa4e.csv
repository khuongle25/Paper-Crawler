Attribute prototype network for zero-shot learning,https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/fa2431bf9d65058fe34e9713e32d60e6-Abstract.html,"From the beginning of zero-shot learning research, visual attributes have been shown to play an important role. In order to better transfer attribute-based knowledge from known to …"
Knowledge-aware zero-shot learning: Survey and perspective,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00070,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) which aims at predicting classes that have never appeared during the training using external knowledge (aka side information) has been widely investigated …
Near-real feature generative network for generalized zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9428229/,"Due to the powerful feature synthesis ability, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is well adapted to the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) task and has achieved great …"
VMAN: A virtual mainstay alignment network for transductive zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9399836/,Transductive zero-shot learning (TZSL) extends conventional ZSL by leveraging (unlabeled) unseen images for model training. A typical method for ZSL involves learning embedding …
Exploring hierarchical graph representation for large-scale zero-shot image classification,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20044-1_7,"The main question we address in this paper is how to scale up visual recognition of unseen classes, also known as zero-shot learning, to tens of thousands of categories as in the …"
Ams-sfe: Towards an alignment of manifold structures via semantic feature expansion for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8784887/,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims at recognizing unseen classes with knowledge transferred from seen classes. This is typically achieved by exploiting a semantic feature space (FS) …
Leveraging balanced semantic embedding for generative zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9927312/,Generative (generalized) zero-shot learning [(G) ZSL] models aim to synthesize unseen class features by using only seen class feature and attribute pairs as training data. However …
Deep semantic structural constraints for zero-shot learning,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/12244,"Zero-shot learning aims to classify unseen image categories by learning a visual-semantic embedding space. In most cases, the traditional methods adopt a separated two-step …"
Integrating topology beyond descriptions for zero-shot learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323004363,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to discriminate object categories through the identification of their attributes and has received much attention for its capability to predict unseen …
Towards effective deep embedding for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9051798/,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) can be formulated as a cross-domain matching problem: after being projected into a joint embedding space, a visual sample will match against all …"
